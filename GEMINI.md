## Directory Overview

This directory appears to contain materials for a mathematical modeling competition, likely the Chinese Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) 2025, based on the file `A题.pdf` (Problem A).

The project is structured with:
*   A main problem description file.
*   A `code` directory for scripts.
*   An `附件` (attachments/appendix) directory for data and results.

## Key Files

*   **`A题.pdf`**: This is the main problem description file for "Problem A" of the competition.
*   **`code/visualization.py`**: A Python script that uses `matplotlib` to generate a top-down 2D visualization of missile, UAV, and target coordinates. It saves the resulting plot as a PNG image.
*   **`附件/result[1-3].xlsx`**: These are Excel spreadsheets. Given the context, they likely contain input data for the problem, or are intended to store the results of the modeling and analysis.

## Usage

This directory is set up to solve the specified mathematical modeling problem. The typical workflow would be:
1.  Analyze the problem described in `A题.pdf`.
2.  Use or develop scripts in the `code` directory (like `visualization.py`) to process data, run simulations, and visualize results.
3.  Store or read data and final results from the Excel files in the `附件` directory.
